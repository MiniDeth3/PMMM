hook,SHIP,"The Hook is a heavily modified iteration of the classic Talon design, boasting an improvised omni-shield generator controlled by a copilot to counter light PD retaliations. It can deal appreciable damage to larger ships when used en masse, though such use usually results in heavy pilot losses.",,,
blasterdrone,SHIP,"This mining auxiliary has been repurposed into an unmanned bomber. The retrofits include a compacted mining blaster and a jury-rigged sensor module to allow limited independent functionality. These modifications entirely disregard the finite energy grid of the original design, resulting in a complete system meltdown upon firing its payload.",,,

tesseract,SHIP,"""This is one of the largest of the anomalous vessel class thus far encountered. Not even a partial specimen has been recovered, much to the consternation of the VP of Research. Some members of the board - unofficially of course - are asking about sabotage or mutiny. I don't think you're quite getting the reality of the situation through to them.""",Unidentified Vessel,"UNKNOWN ENTRY

shrike_omega,SHIP,"""Folks at Disaster Rec received an unusual report following the inspection of Operation Manager Quinn Huang's last reported location. Scans show an eccentric vessel emerging from a disabled [REDACTED] - [See Anomalous Hulls Board Report 5/13 section 17. C]. Posthumous recovery of eyewitnesses Tri-I ocular datastores indicate the vessel's ability to teleport despite readings unlike that of a phase skim-capable craft. As of now, review board agents attribute the readings of the vessel (dubbed ""A.E.O.N."") as akin to a temporal time manipulation field revealing a terrifying possibility.""",Unidentified Vessel,"UNKNOWN ENTRY

fury_omega,SHIP,"""The entire bridge went silent when the comms officer reported what was out there. We witnessed how the 'Worshipful Obedience' had been paralyzed and conflagrated by a mere report... In seconds, we saw it. Brothers and sisters, flayed from reality by some crimson abyss. That... Abomination. It didn't hesitate to move on to the rest of the fleet. They only endured long enough for us to flee...""",Unidentified Vessel,"UNKNOWN ENTRY

derelict_master,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Nothing like this, however, could possibly have been deployed by the Domain drone armadas.

There are elements of standard droneships within the hull structure, but they are covered by malevolently angled glacises and illogical tangles of conduit. Surely this monstrous vessel is the product of some deranged Domain naval architect, or a production chip corrupted by exposure to kilolights of faulty drive field?",,,

kite_P,SHIP,"A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aero shuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This shuttle has been heavily modified by pirates to install an expanded missile rack paired with an advanced autoloader, enabling an impressive missile onslaught despite its compact size. These upgrades came at a cost: the shield generator has been removed, and power has been diverted from the aux propulsion subsystem.",,,
nebula2,SHIP,The Nebula-class Civilian Transport is a prime target of pirate attacks. A few are later found at the broken heart of a sharp spray of impact debris in some lonely orbit. Others earn a pirate's second appraising glance and are hauled to secret shipyards. Crew Quarters are ripped apart and replaced with trusses to hold weapons mounts and souped-up ammo feed lines.,,,
champion2,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser, a versatile mainstay in League fleets, rarely finds its way into pirate hands and even less frequently undergoes a transformation of this magnitude. The focus of this transformation involves the ""Crowning"" energy subsystems conveniently positioned just beneath a formidable heavy energy battery, allowing the seamless rerouting of flux into the energy grid and the installation of an arc emitter. The result is a hull that can unleash catastrophic energy arcs using the ship's accumulated flux, earning it the moniker ""Flux Core."" However, this newfound power comes at a cost. Subsystem reliability takes a hit, and the risk of critical core failures increases.",,,
colossus32,SHIP,"The Colossus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. A similarly haphazard process sees most cargo decks collapsed and re-welded to form thick armor dotted with numerous weapons emplacements. The primary cargo bay was left open, however, and converted into an ersatz fighter launch bay with the addition of a micro civilian forge-vat intended for the manufacture of machine parts hacked to accept fighter LPC chips. The forge is poorly integrated with the hull's base power system, resulting in unreliable overall performance.

The Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,
prometheus3,SHIP,"The Prometheus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. A similarly haphazard process sees most fuel tanks collapsed and re-welded to form thick armor dotted with numerous weapons emplacements. The primary tank has been split open and converted into a vast hangar, allowing increased fighter capacity with the installation of a forge vat.", but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead.

vigilance_pirates,SHIP,"Definitely an odd modification, pirates have stripped most of this Vigilance's armor and rerouted power to a newly installed energized deflective plate. The unrefined nature of this (likely stolen) tech is most likely at fault for the ship's complications when pushed outside its specialization.",,,
